# Bootstrap-5-carousel-multi-items

Bootstrap 5 carousel multiple items (no duplicate HTML node)

I used Vite as a build tool for this project.

After cloning this repo, run the following command `npm run dev`, then visit the link [link](http://localhost:5173/) to check out the carousel.

This project utilizes Sass because it is awesome :), you only need to change the Sass variable `$nbr-of-items` to edit the number items.
